## Recent Improvements & Fixes (Phase 6)

### Architecture Enhancements:
1. **Unified Profile Switching**
   - Removed profile switchers from individual settings screens
   - Single source of truth: Home screen profile selector
   - Auto-reload data on profile changes via Riverpod listeners

   - `process_due_emi_payments()` for automated payment processing
   - Manual trigger via settings screen
   - Error handling and user feedback

---

## Post-Phase 6 Enhancements (Oct 2025)

### UX Improvements: Bottom Sheets for Mobile
1. **Replaced All Dropdowns with Bottom Sheets**
   - Transaction list filter dialog → bottom sheet with DraggableScrollableSheet
   - Transaction form (account & category selectors) → bottom sheets
   - EMI form (account & category selectors) → bottom sheets
   - Recurring transaction form (account, category & frequency) → bottom sheets
   - Transfer form (from & to account selectors) → bottom sheets
   - EMI auto payment settings (interval selector) → bottom sheet
   - **Benefits:** Better mobile UX, consistent UI pattern, easier to use on smaller screens
   - **Pattern:** DraggableScrollableSheet with initialChildSize: 0.6, resizable, scrollable
   - **Features:** Visual handle bar, check icons for selected items, smooth animations

### Session Management & Authentication Fixes
1. **Session Expiration Handling**
   - Fixed flow where expired session left users stuck at PIN entry
   - Added session validation in `verifyPin()` before database queries
   - Auto-redirect to login screen when session expires
   - User-friendly error message: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."
   - 1.5 second delay before auto sign-out for message visibility

2. **Data Serialization Fixes**
   - Fixed UserModel `fromJson()` to handle both formats:
     - Cached data format: `'has_pin'` (boolean from SharedPreferences)
     - Database format: `'pin_hash'` (string from Supabase)
   - Fixed hot reload showing incorrect PIN setup screen
   - Fixed PIN setup cache update to immediately persist changes

3. **Provider Initialization Robustness**
   - Added `Future.microtask()` wrapper to profile provider initialization
   - Prevents build-time state modification errors
   - Consistent with other providers (transaction, account, category, EMI)

### Recurring Transactions Display Fix
1. **Home Screen Upcoming Filter**
   - Fixed filter logic showing "No upcoming recurring transactions" incorrectly
   - Changed window from 7 days to 30 days for better visibility
   - Fixed date range logic:
     - Old: Only checked `isBefore(sevenDaysLater)` (included past dates)
     - New: Checks `isAfter(yesterday)` AND `isBefore(thirtyDaysLater)`
   - Added sorting by next due date (soonest first)
   - Now correctly shows all active recurring transactions due within next 30 days

### Session Management & App Lock Enhancements (Oct 2025)
1. **Persistent Session Management**
   - Re-enabled automatic token refresh (`autoRefreshToken: true`)
   - Sessions now auto-refresh before expiration (never expire until manual logout)
   - Users stay logged in indefinitely like banking apps
   - No more forced logouts or session expiration screens

2. **Offline Data Caching**
   - Implemented profile data caching in SharedPreferences
   - User data caching with fallback support
   - App works fully offline with cached data
   - Graceful handling of database access failures

3. **Configurable App Lock System**
   - Made auto-lock duration fully configurable
   - Default: Lock immediately when app backgrounded
   - Settings-ready: Can choose 30s, 1m, 5m, 10m, or 30m
   - Lock duration persists in SharedPreferences
   - Banking app-style behavior: PIN/biometric on every app open

4. **Authentication Flow Improvements**
   - Simplified auth state checking with cached fallback
   - Removed complex session expiration handling
   - Better error logging and debugging
   - Consistent behavior across cold start and hot reload

### Budget Management System (Oct 2025)
1. **Backend Infrastructure (Complete)**
   - Created complete budget domain layer (models, enums)
   - Implemented budget repository with CRUD operations
   - Built comprehensive budget provider with real-time tracking

2. **Budget Models & Logic**
   - `BudgetModel`: Stores budget limits with configurable periods (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
   - `BudgetPeriod` enum: Supports multiple budget periods
   - `BudgetStatus`: Real-time status with spent/remaining/percentage
   - `BudgetAlertLevel`: Four levels (safe 0-50%, warning 51-80%, critical 81-99%, over-budget 100%+)
   - `BudgetWarning`: Pre-transaction warning system

3. **Automatic Spending Tracking**
   - Real-time spending calculation per category
   - Automatic updates when transactions change
   - Listeners integrated with transaction provider
   - Profile-aware budget tracking

4. **Alert System**
   - Configurable alert threshold (default 80%)
   - Pre-transaction budget warnings
   - Over-budget detection and tracking
   - Helper providers for dashboard integration:
     - `overBudgetProvider`: Lists all over-budget categories
     - `budgetsAtAlertProvider`: Lists categories approaching limit
     - `hasBudgetWarningsProvider`: Boolean for banner display

5. **Soft Limit Approach (Recommended)**
   - Budgets are informational, not restrictive
   - Shows warnings but allows transactions
   - User stays in control
   - Empowering users with awareness while maintaining flexibility

6. **Database Integration**
   - `budgets` table already exists in schema
   - Unique constraint: (profile_id, category_id, period, start_date)
   - RLS policies for data privacy
   - Indexed for performance

7. **Ready for UI Integration**
   - Backend fully functional
   - Providers ready for consumption
   - Helper methods for checking budget status
   - Warning system ready for transaction form
   - Progress calculation ready for progress bars

### Budget Management UI Implementation (Oct 2025)

     - Recurring transactions (UI-level filtering)
     - EMIs with recalculated totals (active count, monthly payment, remaining)
     - Income/Expense summary cards
   - Budget Alerts NOT filtered (category-based, account-agnostic)

7. **Home Screen Layout Improvements**
   - Moved EMI Tracker to bottom of screen (after transactions)
   - Budget Alerts positioned after Income/Expense cards
   - Fixed "See All" navigation for Budget Alerts
